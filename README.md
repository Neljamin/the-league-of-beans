Site: https://theleagueofbeans.com/#/

The website for myself and my friends. We call each other jokingly "The Beans".

Made using React and Styled Components for the frontend, and for the backend it uses the Contentful Delivery API. The pages are metadata-driven so if I add other page content type to my Contentful CMS it will update the site automatically.
